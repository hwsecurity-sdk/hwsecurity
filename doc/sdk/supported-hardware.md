# Supported Hardware

The SDK supports security keys and smartcards with the following protocols: FIDO2 (Passwordless), FIDO U2F (Two-factor), PIV (SSH, TLS), OpenPGP Card (SSH, Encrypt) over NFC and USB.

## Does it Support External NFC/Smartcard Reader?
In theory, the SDK can be configured to use external NFC/smartcard readers connected via USB to the phone.
As this is a niche use case, only a small number of readers are officially supported.
Please contact us, if you plan to use this feature.

Tested readers:

* ACS ACR1252 (contactless, recommended)
* SCM Microsystems Inc. SCR 3310 (contact)
* Gemalto Prox DU (contact + contactless)
